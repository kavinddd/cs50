sort1 uses: Bubble Sort
How do you know?:
random50000: 7.472s
sorted50000: 0.548s
You can notice a big difference amount of time spent of the algorithm sorting data on random50000 and sorted50000.
According to the class, the only algorithm that has differences of Upper Bound (Big O notation), and Lower Bound (Omega) was Bubble Sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: There is not much different of time applying algorithm to random50000/sorted50000/reversed50000.
So, this could be Merge Sort or Selection Sort, but the key difference was time spent. sort2 spent only 0.4s - 0.7s on each files,
which way faster than the Bubble Sort (above answer) which has the same speed as Selection Sort, so the only possible answer here is Merge Sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: There were not much different of time spent running the algorithm (about 3s) to random50000/sorted50000/reversed50000.
So, no difference between upper bound and lower bound of the algorithm.
